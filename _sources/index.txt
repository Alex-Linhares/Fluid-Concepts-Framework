 PySeqsee: A Cognitive Architecture for High-level Perception
==============================================================

Welcome! This is the documentation for PySeqsee |release|, last updated |today|.

PySeqsee is an open-source Python 3 framework for writing programs to 
solve complex problems that are not amenable to brute-force solutions.  
The programs created using Pyseqsee have a blackboard architecture and are 
akin to the computer program Seqsee whose goal is to extend integer 
sequences in a human-like way.  PySeqsee attempts a clean separation of 
the domain-specific aspects of applications from the domain-independent 
parts.

..  note:: 

        Under development.  PySeqsee is a relatively new project with under an 
        year of development by a single developer.  At this stage, PySeqsee 
        is alpha software.  If you wish to change that, help is greatly 
        appreciated.  Drop me a line at amahabal [at] gmail, or better yet, to the 
        mailing list at pyseqsee@googlegroups.com.
