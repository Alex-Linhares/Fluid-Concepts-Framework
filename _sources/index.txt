.. PySeqsee documentation master file, created by

   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

==============================================================
 PySeqsee: A Cognitive Architecture for High-level Perception
==============================================================

.. warning::
  Under development.

  PySeqsee is a relatively new project. It is a Python reimplementation of
  Seqsee, a Perl program whose goal is to understand integer sequences
  in a human-like way.

  The reimplementation is progressing nicely, and the reimplementation has
  made it possible to heavily refactor to allow the use of the architecture in
  other domains. At this stage, though, this is extremely alpha software with a 
  single developer (if you wish to change that, help is greatly appreciated:
  drop me a line at amahabal [at] gmail).
