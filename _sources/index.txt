==============================================================
 PySeqsee: A Cognitive Architecture for High-level Perception
==============================================================

PySeqsee is an open-source Python 3 framework for writing programs to solve
complex problems that are not amenable to brute-force solutions. These programs
have a blackboard architecture and are akin to the computer program Seqsee whose
goal is to extend integer sequences in a human-like way.

PySeqsee can be thought of as a translation of Seqsee from Perl into Python 3
along with a clean separation of the domain-specific bits of Seqsee from the
domain-independent parts. The separation allows PySeqsee to be a framework for
writing similar programs in other domains.

  Under development.

  PySeqsee is a relatively new project with under an year of development, all by
  a single developer.

  At this stage, PySeqsee is alpha software. If you wish to change that, help is
  greatly appreciated. Drop me a line at amahabal [at] gmail, or better yet, to
