A brief motivation and overview of PySeqsee
=============================================

Goals
------

PySeqsee is a framework for writing programs to solve complex problems that are
not amenable to brute-force solutions. It is written in Python. The program that
is driving the framework's development attempts to understand and extend integer
sequences.

Architecture
------------------------

PySeqsee attempts to simulate some aspects of human cognition --- specifically,
the highly context-sensitive nature of thought, the pervasive use of categories,
and our roving-eye attention. It has a black-board architecture, and has much
in common with Hofstadter and Mitchell's Copycat and Bernaard Baars' Global
Workspace Theory.

Why focus on cognition?
-------------------------

Human minds are trivially the smartest machines around. Reverse engineering
some aspects of their functioning could be useful. I say this cautiously, fully
aware that the same minds that seem vastly superior at certain tasks (such as 
at philosophy) also seem woefully inferior in other tasks (such as mindless
number crunching, but also, these days, playing Chess). For the tasks where we
are much better, what enables us to do well, and what parts of these can be used
in programs? A concrete example might provide a partial answer.
