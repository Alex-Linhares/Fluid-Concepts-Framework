Seqsee: an Architecture for Sequence Perception

This project reimplements Seqsee in Python (it was originally in Perl). Seqsee 
is the doctoral work of Abhijit Mahabal (the thesis advisor was Douglas
Hofstadter).

A short video of the Perl version can be found here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KWtRUg8kL8

The dissertation is here: http://www.amahabal.com/files/Seqsee--doublesided.pdf
