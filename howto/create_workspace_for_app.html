<h1>How to create a workspace<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-create-a-workspace" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The workspace is the virtual blackboard on which various codelets make
annotations about their observations and relationships that they have observed.
The workspace will store the pieces of the problem at hand and of the solution
being developed.</p>
<p>In this section, I assume that you have started creating a new app called Cat.
Please note that the skeleton app generated already contains a file for the
workspace.</p>
<div class="section" id="initializing-the-workspace">
<h2>Initializing the workspace<a class="headerlink" href="#initializing-the-workspace" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When you start the cat application using:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">python3</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">m</span> <span class="n">farg</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">apps</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">cat</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">run_cat</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">flags</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>the flags can be used to specify the input. The generated app has a flag called
&#8216;&#8211;input&#8217; and a flag called &#8216;&#8211;expected_output&#8217; for use in automated tests. You
may choose to use names, or you can create a different flags that better reflect
your domain. Seqsee uses the flags &#8216;sequence&#8217; and &#8216;unrevealed_terms&#8217;.</p>
<p>These flags are available in the FLAGS variable. You can access them thus:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">farg.third_party</span> <span class="k">import</span> <span class="n">gflags</span>
<span class="n">FLAGS</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">gflags</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">FLAGS</span>
<span class="n">FLAGS</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">input</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In the &#8220;main&#8221; class (in this example, CatMain in &#8220;run_cat.py&#8221;), you can define
the method ProcessCustomFlags to do any processing at startup. Seqsee uses this
function to convert the input string to a more useful form, a list of numbers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="objects-in-a-workspace">
<h2>Objects in a workspace<a class="headerlink" href="#objects-in-a-workspace" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The way Seqsee works can be described very roughly as follows. The workspace
initially contains numbers from the input sequence. It repeatedly &#8220;focuses on&#8221;
objects in the workspace (initially just numbers, but latter this also includes
other structures that get built up), and such focusing triggers certain actions
either directly or via similarity to recently-focused-upon objects.</p>
<p>For Seqsee to focus on something, it must be an instance of the mixin class
FocusableMixin. This class provides the following over-ridable methods.</p>
<div class="section" id="getfringe">
<h3>GetFringe<a class="headerlink" href="#getfringe" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>I quote from the Seqsee Dissertation:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In his  Principles of Psychology, James (1890) described the fringe as a
penumbra of vague experiences, sometimes using the terms  psychic overtones
or suffusion. Consider the concept of Vietnam. When that concept is evoked, it
does not come alone. It brings along with it, to various degrees, such concepts
as war, Agent Orange, and Iraq; or perhaps  the beautiful beaches and the
brilliant green rice paddies and women in conical hats; or perhaps just idle facts
like &#8220;its capital is Hanoi&#8221; and &#8220;it is near China&#8221;. To each person the package that
is Vietnam is differently filled, but for most, it is not empty. If I next mention
another place, it would appear more or less similar, depending on how, in the
reader&#8217;s mind, its package overlaps with the reader&#8217;s version of the Vietnam
package. Florida with its beaches, China with its rice paddies, Kosovo with its
war, or even New York with its &#8220;I enjoyed my vacation there&#8221; may appear
similar.</p>
<p>Concepts in Seqsee also have such fringes (&#8220;packages&#8221;) of related
concepts. If Seqsee has noticed that, by squinting, the group &#8220;(1 1) 2 3&#8221;  can be
seen as the ascending group &#8220;1 2 3&#8221;, then the fringe of &#8220;(1 1) 2 3&#8221; will contain,
among other things, the concept ascending group, the concept blemished version
of an ascending group, and the concept &#8220;1 2 3&#8221;-group. In this context, the group
&#8220;4 5 6 (7 7) 8&#8221;, being both ascending and blemished-ascending, will appear more
similar to this group than the merely ascending &#8220;5 6 7&#8221; does.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>GetFringe returns the fringe of an object. It is passed in the constructor, and
through it, it has access to the LTM, the coderack, or whatever else it needs. It should
return a list of 2-tuples, the fringe element and its intensity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="getsimilarityaffordances">
<h3>GetSimilarityAffordances<a class="headerlink" href="#getsimilarityaffordances" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When two items are focused on, one soon after the other, and it happens
that their fringes overlap, this method suggests codelets that may be
created to explore the similarity.  For example, in Seqsee, it &#8220;1 2 3&#8221; is seen
soon after &#8220;4 5 6&#8221;, the fringes would overlap since both are ascending groups. In
this case, the &#8216;GetSimilarityAffordances&#8217; for the <em>previous object</em> (in this case,
&#8220;4 5 6&#8221;) is called with three extra arguments: the current focus (&#8220;1 2 3&#8221;), and
the fringes of the two objects. It should returns a list of codelets, 0 or more
of which may finally get added to the coderack.</p>
<p>Since a current focus can overlap with multiple recent items, the GetSimilarityAffordances
method of each is called. They all suggest potential codelets, with an associated urgency.
Approximately two of these are stochastically chosen, biased by their urgency.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="getaffordances">
<h3>GetAffordances<a class="headerlink" href="#getaffordances" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The following quote from Donald Norman&#8217;s <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em>
(2002, p. 9) describes affordances:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The term affordance refers to the perceived and actual properties of the
thing, primarily those fundamental properties that determine just how the
thing could possibly be used.</p>
<p>Affordances provide strong clues for the operations of things.  Plates are
for pushing.  Knobs are for turning.  Slots are for inserting things into.
Balls are for throwing or bouncing.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>All manner of objects &#8212; both physical entities and mental constructs &#8212;
have affordances (here used in the limited sense of &#8216;possible actions suggested
by the object&#8217;). A humorous example is suggested by Mark Twain&#8217;s advice to
writers, &#8220;If you find an adjective, kill it&#8221;, and another by Jeremy Silman&#8217;s advice
to chess players (1998, p. 4): &#8220;The existence of an open center should be likened
to a neon sign saying, &#8216;Castle immediately! Castle immediately!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>The GetAffordances method is called when an object is focused upon, and it should
return a list of codelets that could be run in response to observing this object.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="onfocus">
<h3>OnFocus<a class="headerlink" href="#onfocus" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This is a utility method that is called when an object is focused upon, and is
primarily useful for book-keeping.</p>
