<p>Recently (May 2011), I added the ability to see interlaced sequences such as:</p>

</div>
<p>and (parantheses added for readability):</p>

<p>I will use the recent addition as a case study in adding the ability to see
something that Seqsee did not previously see.</p>
<p>A key philosophy of this entire work is &#8220;No brute force&#8221;.  That is, no
deep exploration should be undertaken by Seqsee without a good cause.
What Seqsee uses is similar in spirit to how one goes about doing math, as
described by George Pólya.  in his books Mathematics and Plausible
Inference.  Pólya makes a strong case for the idea that mathematics
proceeds by educated guesses, and he suggests ways of estimating the
strength of a guess.  Imagine that a mathematician has guessed a new
theorem based on some observation, but has not yet proved the guess to
be correct.  If the guess leads to some prediction that turns out to be
true, the guess is rendered more palatable, more plausible.  If the guess
predicts something surprising that also turns out to be true, this confers
a higher degree of credibility on the guess.  If, furthermore, the guess
is seen to be analogous to some well-known result, it becomes yet more
trustworthy.  Pólya offers dozens of detailed examples (including a
translation of some of Euler&#8217;s writings to the same effect), showing how a
multitude of tiny facts can add up to a fair amount of trust or distrust
in an initial guess, and how these kinds of instincts guide mathematicians
at all stages.  In its far humbler pursuit of extrapolating sequences, I
like to think, Seqsee acts in a similar way.</p>
<p>We thus need to accumulate evidence that a sequence is possibly an interlaced sequence.
Where might such evidence be found?</p>
<p>A hallmark of the interlacing of n sequences is the presence of relations
whose ends are not adjacent.  In Sequence B above, Seqsee will probably
discover that 1 and 4 are related (they are successive squares), 7 and 11
are related (successive primes), and 15 and 21 are related (successive
triangular numbers).  Each of these relations have two intervening numbers
between the two ends (for example, &#8220;7&#8221; and &#8220;6&#8221; are present between &#8220;1&#8221; and
&#8220;4&#8221;), suggesting an interlacing of three sequences.</p>
<p>With the latest change, whenever Seqsee is focusing on a long-distance
relation, it pumps a tiny bit of activation into the long-term memory
concept corresponding to an appropriate number of interlaced sequences.
If this node is sufficiently active, it will have realized that
interlacing might be at play in the sequence at hand and will launch a
subspace to explore this.  The details of how that works do not concern us
here since we are focused on how that concept is awaken rather that what
it does thereafter.</p>
<p>The reason Seqsee does not see Sequence C as of this writing is that
evidence for more complex interlacing is not accumulated.  One way of
awakening the relevant concept is noting that the number of intervening
items between &#8220;7&#8221; and &#8220;8&#8221; in that sequence can be seen as &#8220;2 elements&#8221;
(namely, &#8220;1&#8221; and &#8220;2&#8221;), or as &#8220;1 group&#8221; (namely, &#8220;(1 2)&#8221;).  If it could see
the latter, the two-ness of that sequence (which is more hidden than it is
for Sequence A) will be perceived.</p>
<div class="section" id="accumulation-of-evidence-is-pervasive">
<h2>Accumulation of evidence is pervasive<a class="headerlink" href="#accumulation-of-evidence-is-pervasive" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This idea of slowly awakening a concept based on other tangential activity is present everywhere in Seqsee. Some examples:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The relevance of categories such as Prime is seen this way.  Given a
sequence where primality is relevant, Seqsee will not automatically see
all primes as being primes.  Whenever a &#8220;7&#8221; is focused on, because of the
link between it and &#8220;Prime&#8221; in the LTM, the node for &#8220;Prime&#8221; gets some
activation.  If many primes are present, this activation will climb
quickly.  When it has become sufficiently active, &#8220;7&#8221; or other primes may
get described as primes, thereby adding &#8220;Prime&#8221; to its fringe.  This in
turn will allow it to be seen as similar to &#8220;11&#8221; by virtue of being a
prime.  One the notion Prime is active, it can cause it to see other
things as prime that it could not before (since it did not have an edge
between, say, &#8220;13&#8221; and &#8220;Prime&#8221;).  Extending rightward from (7, 11), Seqsee
will try to describe the next number as Prime.</li>
